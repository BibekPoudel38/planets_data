        "The planet's biodiversity has evolved over billions of years, with millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms.",
        "Earth is located in the habitable zone of the Solar System, where conditions are just right for liquid water to exist.",
        "The Earth’s crust is divided into tectonic plates that move and interact, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountains.",
        "The planet experiences seasonal changes due to the tilt of its axis relative to its orbital plane.",
        "Earth has a layered structure consisting of the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.",
        "The planet’s surface is constantly changing due to processes like erosion, weathering, and plate tectonics.",
        "Earth's average distance from the Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), a distance that light travels in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds."
