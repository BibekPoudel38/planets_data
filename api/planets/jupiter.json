        "Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a mass more than 300 times that of Earth.",
        "It has a powerful magnetic field that is 14 times stronger than Earth's, and it extends up to 7 million kilometers in the Sun’s direction and almost reaches Saturn’s orbit on the other side.",
        "Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.",
        "The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a massive storm that has been raging for at least 400 years, and it is about twice the size of Earth.",
        "Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun.",
        "The planet's rapid rotation causes it to have a slightly flattened shape, with an equatorial diameter larger than its polar diameter.",
        "Jupiter's atmosphere is divided into several bands of clouds, with storms and turbulence occurring where these bands interact.",
        "The planet has a faint ring system composed of dust particles ejected from its moons.",
        "Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun due to the slow gravitational compression of the planet (Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism).",
        "Ganymede, one of Jupiter’s moons, is the largest moon in the Solar System and is even larger than the planet Mercury.",
        "Europa, another Galilean moon, is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust, making it a candidate for potential extraterrestrial life.",
        "Jupiter's magnetic field creates intense radiation belts that can be hazardous to spacecraft and satellites.",
        "The planet was first visited by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft in 1973, followed by several missions including Voyager, Galileo, Juno, and others.",
        "Jupiter's strong gravitational influence has helped shape the structure of the Solar System, including the asteroid belt and the orbits of other planets.",
        "The planet’s atmosphere contains complex cloud patterns and storms, with lightning up to a thousand times more powerful than those on Earth."
