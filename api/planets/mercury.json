        "The Moon is the only celestial body beyond Earth that has been visited by humans.",
        "The Moon is about 4.5 billion years old, roughly the same age as Earth.",
        "The Moon's surface is covered in craters, caused by impacts from meteoroids and asteroids over millions of years.",
        "The Moon has no atmosphere, which means there is no weather, wind, or erosion on its surface.",
        "The Moon's gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's gravity, which allows astronauts to make large leaps and perform acrobatics.",
        "The Moon's gravity also causes tides on Earth through gravitational attraction.",
        "The Moon appears to have phases due to its orbit around Earth and the way sunlight illuminates its surface from different angles.",
        "The Moon's rotation is synchronized with its orbit around Earth, meaning the same side always faces Earth.",
        "The dark areas on the Moon's surface are called maria (Latin for seas) because early astronomers mistakenly thought they were bodies of water.",
        "The Moon's far side, which is never visible from Earth, has a different appearance and fewer maria than the near side.",
        "The Moon has been the subject of many lunar missions, including the Apollo program, which landed astronauts on its surface between 1969 and 1972.",
        "The first human to set foot on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, commander of the Apollo 11 mission, on July 20, 1969.",
        "The Moon has been used as a cultural and religious symbol throughout history, appearing in myths, folklore, and literature from various cultures.",
        "The Moon's surface temperature can vary dramatically, from extremely hot during lunar day to extremely cold during lunar night.",
        "The Moon's surface is covered in a layer of regolith, which consists of loose rocks, dust, and soil.",
        "The Moon has no magnetic field, so it does not have a magnetosphere to protect it from solar radiation.",
        "The Moon has no atmosphere, so there is no sound on its surface. Astronauts communicate using radio transmissions.",
        "The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) per year.",
        "The Moon's origin is still a subject of scientific debate, but the leading theory is that it formed from debris ejected during a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body early in the Solar System's history."
