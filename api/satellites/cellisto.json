    "description": "Callisto is one of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and is the second-largest moon of the planet. It is composed of roughly equal parts of rock and ice and has a heavily cratered surface, indicating little geological activity. Callisto's surface features include impact craters, multi-ring structures, and ancient ridges. It is thought to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust.",
