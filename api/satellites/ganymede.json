        "It is tidally locked to Jupiter, meaning the same side always faces the planet.",
        "Ganymede has a thin oxygen atmosphere, though it is too thin to support human life.",
        "Ganymede has been visited by spacecraft such as Voyager and Galileo, providing valuable data about its composition and surface features."
