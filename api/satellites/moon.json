        "The Moon is the second-brightest object in the Earth's sky after the Sun.",
        "It has a synchronous rotation, meaning it always shows the same face to Earth.",
        "The Moon's surface is covered with craters, basins, and maria, which are large, dark plains formed by ancient volcanic eruptions.",
        "The Moon's gravity affects the Earth's tides.",
        "The first human landing on the Moon was by Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969.",
        "The Moon has no atmosphere, resulting in extreme temperature variations.",
        "The far side of the Moon is often called the 'dark side,' although it receives just as much sunlight as the near side.",
        "The Moon's gravitational interaction with Earth causes tidal locking, meaning its orbital and rotational periods are the same.",
        "Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth is directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon.",
        "The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 cm per year.",
        "The surface of the Moon has a layer of fine, powdery dust called regolith.",
        "The Moon has been visited by twelve astronauts during six Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972.",
        "The Moon's lack of atmosphere and water means it has no weather and no erosion, so its surface changes very little over time.",
        "The Moon has weak and irregular magnetic fields in certain regions, possibly remnants of an ancient global magnetic field."
